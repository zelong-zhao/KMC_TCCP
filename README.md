# Kenetic Monte Carlo For Porphyrin Molecules

This is the Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) script for executing simulations of porphyrin molecules.
https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c02941

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Fortran > 6.1

### Installation 

make install

# Usage

Run the `kmc_executable.out` with `[inputs.dat]` and optionally `[input_TPD.dat]`, ensuring these files are located in the appropriate directory.
The `inputs.dat` file allows you to tweak all parameters, including aspects such as lattice size, coupling strength, etc. 
For a TPD simulation, an `input_TPD.dat` file is required to be present in the execution directory.
